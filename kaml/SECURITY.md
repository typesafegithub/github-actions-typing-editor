# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version of kaml is supported with security fixes. Older versions are not supported.

Sample projects are provided as-is. While I will endeavour to fix any issues reported, they are intended as educational examples, not production-ready code.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover or suspect you have discovered a vulnerability, please report it through [GitHub's security vulnerability reporting tool](https://github.com/charleskorn/kaml/security/advisories).
Please include a short description of the issue and steps on how to reproduce it.

The issue will be investigated and fixed privately, then disclosed publicly once a fix is available.

Anyone who reports a vulnerability will be acknowledged in the release notes and security advisory.
